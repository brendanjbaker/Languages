For the X programming language:

* Show installing on Debian 13.
  * Install via `apt-get` using default Debian repositories if available (main or contrib).
  * Otherwise, download & install a binary distribution.
  * Otherwise, download & compile from source.
  * Otherwise, add & use an official third-party repository.
* Write an idiomatic "Hello, world!" program in a file called `program.X` or `Program.X`, capitalizing it if customary, and where `X` is its normal extension. Also, similarly, write a program that sums the numbers 0-100 (inclusive), and prints JUST the output.
* Show compiling it, if customary and applicable.
* Show running it.
