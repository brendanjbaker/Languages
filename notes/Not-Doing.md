**ALGOL-58**

Originally proposed as "IAL" (International Algebraic Language), there is no working compiler or interpreter for ALGOL-58 that exists.

It may be fair to consider the JOVIAL language as the implementation of the ALGOL-58 idea (with some added extensions).

**Associative Programming Language**

Database language from the 1960s. (Not the same as the APL programming language.)

**Duckling**

It has not been released publicly yet.

**Epsilon**

It's currently undergoing a re-write, and doesn't work.

**Jiyu**

Its GitHub was removed or made private.

**STRIPS**

STRIPS is a plan-solving mechanism, not a programming language.
