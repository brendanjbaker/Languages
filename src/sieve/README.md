# Sieve

⚠️ Sieve is a mail-processing language, and although it has some facilities for
variables and control flow, it is not suitable for creating general-purpose
programs. Therefore, only the `hello` world can be implemented.

The `freestyle` program is implemented as well, showing some interesting Sieve
filtering capabilities.
