# Xojo

I think these Xojo programs are correct, however:

⚠️ You cannot download Xojo without an account.
⚠️ You cannot run Xojo code without using the IDE (GUI).
⚠️ You cannot build Xojo code without a license.

_There is an "IDE Communicator" project that can be used to automate IDE actions, however I cannot get the GUI to work in a container, even with `xvfb`, and I don't think building will work without a license, anyway._

Therefore, a `.skip` file has been placed in this directory to disable it.
